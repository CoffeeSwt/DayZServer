Hi 
   I have added some  files for xml based on the bear  to give a guide  , pls tryand  use these and if you improve  let me know and  ill add them to the upload  cheers

 So here is the  Beta test of the Raptors , thankyou for being a  valued supporter of my work  and pls enjoy this early  insight and with your feedback i can get it to the masses soon as 

 What can you do with this ? 
 1st you must always follow the lisence which is basically  do not share  and or edit this addon  in anyway different to what is stated here within and  below 
 
 you may take this folder and its contents meaning .pbo ,readmey and bikey  and place it  in your own server upload folder on steam  or whichever method you have chosen to distribute your server addons , with a means to allow your server  clients to downlaod it and play on your server alone .  you must sate that certain addons are not transferable via your own comms and by leaving this readme in the downloads

cheers
